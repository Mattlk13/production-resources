# O'Reilly Oriole Guidelines and Resources

Oriole is a unique new medium that blends code, data, text, and video into a narrated learning experience with executable content.

# Author's Guide: Creating an Oriole with Atlas and LaunchBot

## Introduction



## Writing the Notebook Content

The text in the notebook isn’t intended to mirror the voice-over in the video—it's not meant to be a transcript. The text should be brief and stand on its own in case a viewer prefers to read through text+code instead of watching the video.

## Recording the Video

The video is intended to guide a viewer as they scroll down the page and try the code examples. It isn’t a mirror of the content, but should always refer to it.

## Introduction in the Video

The introduction should include:
* a brief bio about the author (1 min)
* explain the “big picture” of what the notebook demonstrates, and give a brief outline of what the viewer should expect from the lesson (aim for 1–2 minutes)

The Introduction is the only video segment shown in full-screen width, so it becomes the main opportunity to connect with the viewer; be casual, accessible, and human.

The remainder of the video (~25 minutes) will appear in a smaller window—unless required by the lesson. Body expressions should be BIG rather than small movements, so they get noticed. Even so, keep eye contact with the camera most of the time. The author stands behind their laptop while recording the video, to refer to the context of the text+code while working through the notebook.

Code won't execute automatically as the video plays, so the author should invite viewers to run the code, and even pause the video to experiment on their own with the examples.

It’s possible to enlarge the video in an Oriole on a cue, so the author can explain something outside of the screen. Ideally this would happen on a whiteboard or a large piece of paper. Whatever gets written should be large and simple enough to be read on a small screen.

When you finish a sentence, don’t just look down at the computer. Make a point to pause and smile, breathe, especially during the intro section. We need to plan for sync’ing video with the notebook.
